# Tutorials

Here are some tutorials I've written, as well as some third-party tutorials (see below).

Labyrinth

A simple class to represent a labyrinth, useful for lots of things!



Third-Party Tutorials

These are tutorials on Python 3 and Kaggle from www.python.org and www.dataquest.io which have been translated into Jupyter notebooks.  

Please visit those sites for further questions or to see original code, etc.
